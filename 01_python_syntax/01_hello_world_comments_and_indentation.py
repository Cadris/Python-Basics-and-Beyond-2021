# INDENTATION

"""
    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

"""
    Comments can be used to explain Python code.
    Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
